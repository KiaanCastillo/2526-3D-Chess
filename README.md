3D Chess Rules:
Regular chess rules apply to all pieces except when moving across boards, a piece is only allowed to move a maximum of tiles equivalent
to the difference between the current layer it is on and the layer it wants to move to.

Example:
A rook is on layer 3.
Possible moves it can make on layer:
<ol>
  <li>Normal moves  |  Max Tiles it Can Move: 2</li>
  <li>Normal moves  |  Max Tiles it Can Move: 1</li>
  <li>Normal moves  |  Max Tiles it Can Move: 7</li>
</ol>
