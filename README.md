3D Chess Rules: <br />
Regular chess rules apply to all pieces except when moving across boards, a piece is only allowed to move a maximum of tiles equivalent
to the difference between the current layer it is on and the layer it wants to move to.

Example: <br />
A rook is on layer 3.
Possible moves it can make on:
<ul>
  <li>Layer 1: Normal moves  |  Max Tiles it Can Move: 2</li>
  <li>Layer 2: Normal moves  |  Max Tiles it Can Move: 1</li>
  <li>Layer 3: Normal moves  |  Max Tiles it Can Move: 7 (Regular chess movement)</li>
</ul>

To play the game, download the executable .jar file "3DChess.jar".
